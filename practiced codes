1)Deleting Nth node froma linked list 
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* removeNthFromEnd(ListNode* head, int n) 
    {
        int count=0;
        ListNode *temp=head;
        if(head==0)
        return head;
        while(temp)
            {
                count++;
                temp=temp->next;
            }
        if(count==n)
        {
            head=head->next;//it means if head is pointing to 1st variable we are making 
            it ot point to 2nd variable and returning the head,hence the first variable is removed 
            return head;
        }
        temp=head;//everything went well here we need to re initialize temp 
        back to the head,so we could start from the 1st node
        n=count-n-1;
        count=0;
        while(temp)
        {
            if(count==n)
            {
                temp->next=temp->next->next;//it means when the count is equal to the required 
                position-1 then we could skip the the position by incrementing count->next to count->next->next
            }
            count++;
            temp=temp->next;
        }
        return head;
    }
};
